        <h2>Principles</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Limit your WIP (Work In Progress)</li>
            <li>Do not prioritize tasks - instead use a column for things you might do, and a column for things you are going to do next</li>
            <li>No fields/metadata: Everything about the task should be in its title and description</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
